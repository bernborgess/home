My name is Bernardo Borges, and I am writing to express my interest in pursuing a PhD opportunity at
UNIVERSITY under your esteemed guidance.
I have been working as a researcher under Professor \link[Haniel Barbosa]{https://hanielbarbosa.com/}
at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil, in my graduation in Computer Science.
I have been working in the field of Formal Methods applied to his research in Satisfability Modulo
Theories, what prompted me to learn Lean 4 and use it to formalize proof steps to be used in the
\link[cvc5]{https://cvc5.github.io/} tool.
In general I am interested in Functional Programming, Type Theory and Verification, as well as logic.

Given your work related to Lean, I am motivated to explore the possibility of contributing and learning
from your research group. I would be grateful if you could provide information on any available PhD
positions within your group or any upcoming opportunities to collaborate.
Additionally, I would appreciate any guidance on the application process and requirements for
prospective PhD candidates.

Thank you very much for considering my inquiry. I look forward to the possibility of discussing
this further.
